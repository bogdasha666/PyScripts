### Enhance Your *Counter-Strike 2* Experience

**PyScripts** is a lightweight, open-source toolkit for *Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)* that lets you personalize and streamline your gameplay. It works externally‚Äînever modifying game memory or files‚Äîusing only what CS2 provides through console commands, Game State Integration (GSI), and log files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**PyScripts** is a personal project by an independent developer, not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve Corporation, the creators of CS2. It offers features like *Auto Accept*, *Jump Throw*, and *Bomb Timer* to enhance convenience and fun. However:

- **Valve‚Äôs Rules**: Some features automate actions via external inputs or scripts. Valve discourages automation in competitive play, and while *PyScripts* avoids game memory manipulation (no VAC violations), **use in official matchmaking may still risk account bans** at Valve‚Äôs discretion.
- **User Responsibility**: You are solely responsible for complying with [Valve‚Äôs Terms of Service](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/) and [CS2 Rules](https://www.counter-strike.net/). The developer is not liable for bans, data issues, or loss of functionality.
- **Intended Use**: This tool is for personal enjoyment, experimentation, and learning‚Äînot for gaining unfair advantages. Use it responsibly in appropriate settings (e.g., private servers or casual play) to respect the CS2 community.

## ‚ú® What is PyScripts?

**PyScripts** is a utility that adds convenience and flair to CS2 through an external overlay and automation features. It leverages:

- **External Overlay**: Tracks CS2‚Äôs window for visual enhancements.
- **Config & Binds**: Executes commands via CS2‚Äôs built-in exec system (e.g., bind "KEY" "exec pyscripts1").
- **Game State Integration (GSI)**: Reads live game data like weapon status or bomb timers.
- **Console Logs**: Parses console.log for events like match acceptance.

No game files are altered beyond user-created configs, and no hacks are involved‚Äîjust clean, creative tools for CS2 enthusiasts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Get started easily:
1. Download Python: Visit the official Python downloads page at python.org and download the latest stable version (e.g., Python‚ÄØ3.13.5 as of June‚ÄØ11,‚ÄØ2025) for your platform. During installation, make sure to check ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù
2. **Download**: Grab the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/PyScripts/releases).
3. **Set Launch Options**: In Steam, add -conclearlog -condebug +exec pyscripts0 to CS2‚Äôs launch options.
4. **First Run**: Launch install_requirements.bat to install Python Libraries then PyScripts.py *before* CS2 (afterward, it‚Äôs fine to start with CS2 running).
5. **Play**: Open CS2, configure settings in the PyScripts menu (*press Insert to show/hide the menu*), and enjoy!
6. **Exit**: Close via the bind button in the menu or the exit button.

You can change the key bindings for opening the menu and exiting the program in **Menu ‚Üí Custom Binds**.

## üß† How It Works

*PyScripts* enhances CS2 safely and externally by:

- **Command Sending**: Features like *Jump Throw*, *Drop Bomb*, and *Auto Pistol* work by writing CS2 commands to numbered config files (e.g., pyscripts1.cfg). These are triggered via pre-bound keys (e.g., F13 to F24) simulated by *PyScripts*. In CS2, you bind a key to exec pyscripts1 (set via launch options), and *PyScripts* presses that key to run the command.
- **Auto Accept**: Monitors console.log for match detection, then simulates a mouse click on the "Accept" button.
- **Sniper Crosshair**: Reads active weapon data from GSI and overlays a custom crosshair synced with your settings.
- **Bomb Timer**: Tracks bomb state via GSI, updating the display with defuse urgency cues.
- **RGB Crosshair**: Cycles colors by sending console commands to adjust crosshair settings.
- **Knife Switch**: Uses switchhands via config files triggered by keybinds.

This method relies entirely on CS2‚Äôs native systems‚Äîno memory reading, writing, or injection‚Äîkeeping it aligned with standard scripting practices while avoiding game file tampering.
